THRIVE

After-Tax Financial Intelligence for Real-World Wealth

🧠 Short Description 

Thrive is a personal financial intelligence app that reveals your true, after-tax, real-world net wealth—helping users understand what they actually have, not what dashboards pretend they own.

📖 Long Description (Hackathon-Ready)

Most financial apps lie by omission. They show balances, charts, and “returns” without accounting for taxes, liquidity, or real-world friction. As a result, users believe they are wealthier—and safer—than they truly are.

Thrive solves this by reframing personal finance around after-tax, liquid reality. Instead of focusing on trading signals or speculative gains, Thrive calculates what a user would actually walk away with if they liquidated today—after federal taxes, estimated state taxes, and holding duration are applied.

The platform is designed as a Personal Financial Intelligence System, not a trading app. It prioritizes clarity over dopamine, conviction over hype, and long-term financial independence over short-term gambling. Thrive is built for individuals who want truth, not theatrics.

Target users include retail investors, crypto participants, and financially curious individuals who want to understand their real financial position and make better long-term decisions based on reality rather than illusion.
